# Sales Data Analysis

## Purpose
This Power BI project aims to analyze sales data to identify trends, top-selling products, and revenue metrics to aid in business decision-making.

## Description
The Sales Data Analysis project involves delving into a comprehensive sales dataset to derive actionable insights. It encompasses exploring sales trends over time, pinpointing the best-selling products, and calculating key revenue metrics such as total sales and profit margins. The project is a testament to the ability to manipulate large datasets and make data-driven sales strategy recommendations.

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following columns:
- Order ID
- Product
- Quantity Ordered
- Price Each
- Order Date
- Purchase Address
- Month
- Sales
- City
- Hour

## Transformation of Data
Data transformation was executed in Power BI using the following steps:
1. Data upload using the 'Get Data' feature.
2. Promotion of headers and type detection in the 'Transform' tab.
3. Splitting of the datetime column into separate date and time columns.

## Visualization
The data was visualized using several Power BI features:
- Line charts for sales trends over time.
- Donut charts for the best-selling products.
- Stacked bar charts for top-selling products.
- Geographic maps for city-wise sales.
- Column charts for weekly sales distribution.
- Slicers for interactive filtering.

## Revenue Metrics
Calculated key financial metrics using Power BI's 'Card' visual:
- Total profit: Calculated as the sum of net profits.
- Sales quantity: Total units sold.
- Profit margin: Ratio of net profit to total revenue, expressed as a percentage.
